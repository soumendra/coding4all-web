                                            <p>That is the reason, during this course, we encourage teachers to only focus student attention on exactly what students “need to know” at that particular stage.</p>

That means students don’t need to really know the full version control or all the operations.

                                            <p>In our experience, students really enjoy making their personal websites, making changes at will, and demonstrating the same to their friends and family.

                                          <p><code>Option-2 </code>You will finish the first module. Take an optional break for a month or two (or maybe more). Continue with the second module with the same set of students whom you taught in the first module OR start afresh and teach the first module to a new set of students.</p>
                                          <p>We want to give you as much flexibility as possible. Also, there will always be breaks between the modules due to students’ exams or teachers’ other personal commitments. </p>
