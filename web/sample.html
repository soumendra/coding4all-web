                              <p>We want to make computer education accessible to each student in India regardless of their
parents' qualifications or financial background.</p>

<p>We create a cohort of 4 students from underprivileged backgrounds ranging between class 8 to class 11 and then arrange a teacher for them, preferably a working professional from the tech industry.</p>

                                <p>Breaking the shackles of poverty is a long and generational process with unlimited & uncontrollable moving parts. Nobody can guarantee that. But the least we can do is to give access to students to computer programming, so they may consider opting for a computer graduation course after the 12th. Apart from engineering, there are other degree courses also available in computer science. And it is well established that computer programming knowledge leads to better career prospects.</p>

                                <p>This program is made for teaching computer programming to underprivileged students only.

We want your efforts to go in the right direction and towards meaningful change.</p>
                                <p>Side note - If this is your first time working with high school students, one thing you need to keep in mind is that while most of the students are expressive and respond in the class, there are always a few quiet and shy ones. So, don’t get bogged down. In our experience, they also come along once a couple of classes are done. </p>
                                <p>We also take feedback from teachers & students during the mid-course and implement changes if any. </p>

                                <p>The core philosophy behind the Coding4All course designing is the Top-Down approach. We believe that our main purpose behind this program is to ignite curiosity in students about computers and programming.</p>
                                <p>We put very high emphasis on relatable, measurable, and publishable outcomes after every module. And that is the reason we prioritize website deployment against few of the other theoretical things. In fact, this current course is not about programming and more about computers, tools, websites, and empowering kids to express their own creativity.</p>
                                <p>That is the reason, during this course, we encourage teachers to only focus student attention on exactly what students “need to know” at that particular stage.</p>

That means students don’t need to really know the full version control or all the operations. They only need to know the basic operations that empower them to deploy the code to their websites and make changes.</p>
                                <p>In our experience, students really enjoy making their personal websites, making changes at will, and demonstrating the same to their friends and family. We want to enable and encourage this behavior. That’s why Github. Plus Github pages make hosting very easy.</p>

                              <p><code>Option-1 </code>You only want to commit to the first module (8 sessions and 10 to 12 hours). You will discontinue after this and will resume later only if you feel like it. No hard commitments.</p>
                              <p><code>Option-2 </code>You will finish the first module. Take an optional break for a month or two (or maybe more). Continue with the second module with the same set of students whom you taught in the first module OR start afresh and teach the first module to a new set of students.</p>
                              <p>We want to give you as much flexibility as possible. Also, there will always be breaks between the modules due to students’ exams or teachers’ other personal commitments. </p>
